## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learned the basics about GitHub regarding to how to create a repository and to publish the solution of challenge on live site through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). In relation to HTML and CSS, this challenge has been an enjoyable way to practice the basic concepts on semantic HTML5 to strucutre the page content and CSS to apply styles to develop the page as the challenge so requested.

### Continued development

The next steps are focusing me on learning about CSS Grid designs as well as improving the use of flex desings, and practice through more challenges to refine my skills.
